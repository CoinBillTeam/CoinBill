# CoinBill Core BlockChain Client

From basic trading to coin-based derivatives trading by Bill Contract
A new distributed trading platform that can support all derivative products such as block chains, futures, options, and swaps driven by Bill Contract

## About
CoinBill project team is creating a distributed trading platform with a variety of trades (derivative products) by redesigning the Smart Contract and supporting cross-chains by creating Opartz, a new language compatible with CoinBill Virtual machine (CBVM) and Solidity. CoinBill platform is a marketplace that supports general trades as well as derivative products, and can be traded on a distributed system, unlike other centralized exchanges. The CoinBill system has a hybrid architecture based on CBVM and Bill Contract which redesigned the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). Thanks to the architecture, the CoinBill can be compatible with a variety of coins, including ERC-20 tokens and Bitcoin block chain-based coins and fulfill contracts between users at a faster rate by supporting cross-chains, atomic swaps, and lightning network technologies as a next-generation system that has never existed before. For more information, please refer to Whitepaper.

## Contact us
Based on the joint TF announcement by the Korea Financial Services Commission with crypto currency related institutes on September 29, 2017, we decided that it would be difficult for the Korean corporation and foundation to proceed smoothly with ICO.
Therefore, we are seeking fund investors to proceed with ICO by establishing a corporation in other countries. Interviews are also underway to understand customers, so please feel free to contact us. Thank you.
